## Projects

### 1. Classification of Iris Flowers using Logistic Regression

- Description: One of the introductory project I did in my university which leverage on the Iris dataset from sklearn library. The classes of the flowers are determined based on 4 criteria, petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width using Logistic Regression.
- Folder: [Classification - Iris dataset](Classification%20-%20Iris%20dataset)
- Key Files: iris classifier.ipynb

### 2. Prediction of Credit Card Default

- Description: Introduction project from Kaggle aiming to predict whether a credit card user is likely to be defaulted based on the demographic factors and historical payments record. 
- Folder: [Classification - CC Default Prediction](Classification%20-%20credit%20card%20default)
- Key Files: cc_application.ipynb
